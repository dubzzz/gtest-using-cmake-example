# Google Test using CMake -- example

This repository provides a very simple example of how defining a CMakeLists.txt in order to run unit-tests using Google Test framework.

The build system cross-platform (GNU/linux, Windows) and cross-compilers (clang, g++ and visual studio) is also considered.
- .travis.yml: configuration to build such projects on Unix-based platforms with clang or g++.
- appveyor.yml: configuration to build such projects on Windows platforms using Visual Studio compiler
